git init -b main

git commit



Create Gihub repository if have not done so yet.

git config remote.origin.url git+ssh://git@github.com/<user>/<your-repository>.git

In my case:
git config remote.origin.url git+ssh://git@github.com/eldarm/NewHireDilemma2023.git

Verify your configuration:
git config -l

You should see at least user.name, user.email and remote.origin.url, in my case:
user.name=eldarm
user.email=junk@eldar.com
and
remote.origin.url=git+ssh://git@github.com/eldarm/NewHireDilemma2023.git


Generate keys:
ssh-keygen
Put them into ~/.ssh/
for example: ~/.ssh/myghkeys
You will get two files there:
myghkeys and myghkeys.pub

In Gitub go to your profile | setting | my SSH keys, and add an SSH key.
Name it as you like, copy the content of your *.pub file, you just generated, in my case myghleys.pub.

Verify that keys work:
ssh -T git@github.com

First time you will get a warning, just agree. The second time you will get congrats:
Hi <your name>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Finally, you can push your code to Github:

git push -u origin main

Done.
